VICTORY!
After a long while of struggles, testing, and aggressive coding I have done it! While basic, it is an acomplishment to me as I managed to figure out a lot of my issues and solved them on my own! If anything, it taught me a lot about how Godot works.

Now, all the sprites seen (The UFO, the PC-controlled spaceship, the nuke & missle, the meteor, and the enemy lasers) are all drawn (painfully) 
are all drawn by me myself and I. Painfully, but managed. 

I hope it is fun to look at the very least ;D
